# Spotify Web Player

I build a Spotify Web-based Player that Spotify premium users can log in to listen to music from any device. The user is able to view his/her recently played songs directly from the home page. Find out he/her favorite artists and top songs on the Profile page. View a list of playlists on the Playlist page.

## How it works

To login into the Spotify Web Player, the user must be a Spotify Premium User. By clicking the login button, the user will have to agree to log in using your Spotify account.

Once successfully login, you will be redirected to the home page of Spotify Web Player.
